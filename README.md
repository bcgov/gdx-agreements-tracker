# GDX Agreements Tracker

## Installation
* ```git clone https://github.com/bcgov/gdx-agreements-tracker.git```

## Development All-in-One Quick Start
If you have Docker:
```bash
cd gdx-agreements-tracker
docker compose up --build -d
```
The app is then available at [http://localhost:82/](http://localhost:82/). For your reference, the API is available at [http://localhost:82/api/](http://localhost:82/api/). The websocket for the frontend react is available at http://localhost:3001/ and as long as the `frontend/.env` file (or other similar facility) specifies the WDS_SOCKET_PORT as 3001, the React live-refresh-upon-code-change feature should work in your browser. 

Logs end up in `docker/logs/` in `backend`, `frontend`, and `nginx` subdirectories for your debugging convenience.

If you haven't done a `yarn install` or `npm install` in the frontend or backend subdirectories before executing the above, the docker-compose will handle that for you. This is useful if your local node/npm are not the right version.

### Try a Production Build in Local Dev
If your containers are running, as per above:

* `docker compose exec frontend yarn build` and wait for the build to complete
* Refresh [http://localhost:82/](http://localhost:82/)

To go back to live-refresh local development node server:
* Delete the contents of `frontend/build` directory
* Refresh [http://localhost:82/](http://localhost:82/)
