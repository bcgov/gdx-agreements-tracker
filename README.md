# GDX Agreements Tracker

## Installation
* ```git clone https://github.com/bcgov/gdx-agreements-tracker.git```

## Development All-in-One Quick Start
If you have Docker:
```bash
cd gdx-agreements-tracker
docker compose up --build -d
```
The app is then available at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/). For your reference, the API is available at [http://localhost/api/](http://localhost/api/). The websocket for the frontend react is available at http://localhost:3000/ and as long as the `frontend/.env` file (or other similar facility) specifies the WDS_SOCKET_PORT as 3000, the React live-refresh-upon-code-change feature should work in your browser. 

Logs end up in `docker/logs/` in `backend`, `frontend`, and `nginx` subdirectories for your debugging convenience.

If you haven't done a `yarn install` or `npm install` in the frontend or backend subdirectories before executing the above, the docker-compose will handle that for you. This is useful if your local node/npm are not the right version.

### Various Actions Useful for Development
#### To Stop and Remove All Development Containers
`docker compose down`

#### To Update Packages After Changing `package.json`
* Frontend: `docker compose exec frontend yarn install`
* Backend: `docker compose exec backend npm install`

#### To Stop, Start, Restart, Remove, and Get a Shell Inside a Container
These are all demonstrated below on the `web` container, but can work on any of `frontend`, `backend`, or `db` as well, just change the container name on the lines below accordingly.
* Stop: `docker compose stop web`
* Start: `docker compose start web`
* Restart: `docker compose restart web`
* Remove: `docker compose rm web`
* Get a shell inside the container: `docker compose exec web /bin/sh`

### If You Want to Try a Production Build in Local Dev
Open `frontend/Docker/nginx.conf` find the `location / {` section and **uncomment the `try_files` line** so the section looks like this:
```
location / {
    # this will let you try out a static build on dev. delete build/index.html to go back to using the node server.
    # if the request can be served from the build directory, try it first, otherwise shunt it to the proxy.\
    try_files $uri $uri/ @app_proxy;
    error_page 403 = @app_proxy;
    error_page 404 = @app_proxy;
}
```
Then restart the web container:
* `docker compose restart web`

If your containers are running, as per above:

* `docker compose exec frontend yarn build` and wait for the build to complete
* Refresh [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

To go back to live-refresh local development node server:
* Temporarily:
  * Delete the contents of `frontend/build` directory (`rm -rf build/*`)
  * Refresh [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)
* Permanently:
  * Delete the contents of `frontend/build` directory
  * Comment out the `try_files` line in nginx.conf as per above by placing a `#` before `try_files`
  * Restart the web container
    * `docker compose restart web`

## Development Ã  la Carte

### Front End

#### Setup
* ```cd gdx-agreements-tracker/frontend```
* ```yarn install```
* Commands
    * ```yarn start``` - starts front end app on localhost:3000
    * ```yarn build``` - builds for production deployment

#### Build
* ```cd gdx-agreements-tracker-front-end/frontend```
* ```docker build -t gdx-agreements-tracker-front-end:latest .```
* Test build by running ```docker run -p 8081:80 --rm gdx-agreements-tracker-front-end```


### Back End

#### Setup
* ```cd gdx-agreements-tracker/backend```
* ```npm i```
* Commands
  * ```npm run start``` - to start api server on localhost:8080
  * ```npm run test``` - to run tests.

#### Build
* ```cd gdx-agreements-tracker/backend```
* ```docker build -t gdx-agreements-tracker-api:latest .```
