### January 11, 2022 WD-3815
* backend
    * added unified logger (facilities/logging.js)
      * set environment variable NODE_ENV to 'production' when deploying to production
      * uses pino library for logging in the whole app (fastify uses it, and it is pretty slick)
        * there is one logger instance, with the option to use child logger instances
          * conveniently group log entries by file/role/request
          * usage: `const log = require('../facilities/logging.js')(module.filename);` at the top of your file that needs logging
            * the `module.filename` makes a new child logger for you that will group all log messages in that file for you
            * use `log.child({ subcomponent: 'someUniqueStringYouLike' })` to make a sub-child log if you need. perhaps for logging individual requests/sessions.
      * updated fastify to use new logger
      * updated database to use new logger
    * moved database auto-deploy logic to a more appropriate spot (startup, not every db check)
    * cleanup server.js: moved shutdown handlers into daemon.js
    * restructuring
      * new directory: facilities: for full-on components, not just helpers
      * moved daemon.js to facilities directory
      * helpers/auth.js -> facilities/keycloak.js because keycloak items are what is in there, and it is more than helpers
      * helpers/server.js -> facilities/fastify.js because fastify configuration items are in there, and fastify is not just a helper

    * added plugin fastifyRoles
    * changed the logger default level to debug.
    * structure for payload is now {data: payload} instead of just payload, this allows other objects to be passed along with the data.
