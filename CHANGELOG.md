### January 11, 2022 WD-3815

- backend
  - added unified logger (facilities/logging.js)
    - set environment variable NODE_ENV to 'production' when deploying to production
    - uses pino library for logging in the whole app (fastify uses it, and it is pretty slick)
      - there is one logger instance, with the option to use child logger instances
        - conveniently group log entries by file/role/request
        - usage: `const log = require('../facilities/logging.js')(module.filename);` at the top of your file that needs logging
          - the `module.filename` makes a new child logger for you that will group all log messages in that file for you
          - use `log.child({ subcomponent: 'someUniqueStringYouLike' })` to make a sub-child log if you need. perhaps for logging individual requests/sessions.
    - updated fastify to use new logger
    - updated database to use new logger
  - moved database auto-deploy logic to a more appropriate spot (startup, not every db check)
  - cleanup server.js: moved shutdown handlers into daemon.js
  - restructuring
    - new directory: facilities: for full-on components, not just helpers
    - moved daemon.js to facilities directory
    - helpers/auth.js -> facilities/keycloak.js because keycloak items are what is in there, and it is more than helpers
    - helpers/server.js -> facilities/fastify.js because fastify configuration items are in there, and fastify is not just a helper
